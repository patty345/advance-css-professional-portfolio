## Adance CSS Professional Portfolio

For this weeks challenge i created my professional portfolio which is written in HTML and CSS which is a starting point
for future enhanchement. Used the skills that i have learned in the course of two weeks in the bootcamp. Keeping in mind the following requirements:

- WHEN I load their portfolio
  THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
  THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
- WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
  THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
- WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
  THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others.
- WHEN I click on the images of the applications
  THEN I am taken to that deployed application.
- WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
  THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport.
